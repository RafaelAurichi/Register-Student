This guide provides a step-by-step instruction for loading a React Native app. If you are new to React Native, this guide will help you to get started with a basic project setup.

# Prerequisites
To get started with this guide, you should have:

Node.js installed on your system
React Native CLI installed globally
A code editor (such as VS Code)

# Steps
Create a new React Native project by running the following command in your terminal:

**npx react-native init MyApp** -
This will create a new project named MyApp in your current directory.

Navigate to your project directory and start the development server by running the following command:

**cd MyApp**, 
**npm start** -
In a new terminal window, run the following command to launch the app in a simulator or on a connected device:

**npx react-native run-ios** -
This command will build and run the app in the iOS simulator. **If you want to run the app in the Android emulator, replace ios with android in the command above.

Once the app is launched in the simulator or on the device, you should see the default React Native app screen.

Now, open the project in your code editor and start editing the code. You can make changes to the code and see the changes live in the simulator or on the device.

To test the app on a real device, you can build the app using Xcode or Android Studio. You can find instructions for building the app in the React Native documentation.

# Conclusion
In this guide, we have shown you how to create a new React Native project, start the development server, launch the app in a simulator or on a device, and edit the code.
